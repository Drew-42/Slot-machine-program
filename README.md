# Slot-machine-program
This script simulates a slot machine. The user starts out with $100 and can bet any lesser amount. If, after 'pulling the lever', the player gets 3 identical symbols, they will receive a payout (the amount varies from symbol to symbol). If they continue to play, the game ends after multiple rounds when the balance finally reaches 0. If the user plays continuously, losing all the money eventually is guaranteed.

I further practiced using the random module and the main() function correctly, putting the important functional units outside of main().
